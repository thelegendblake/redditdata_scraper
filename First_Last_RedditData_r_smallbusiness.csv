o5j5jva,Growing too fast and drowning in cash flow issues,"More businesses die from indigestion than starvation.

You definitely have a common problem. I still have to cut offense side actions in my business at some point every year due to catching up cash flow/inventory/manufacturing/ unexpected hurdle with my customer acquisition velocity. 

I manufacture and sell commercial truck parts. B2b

I did switch all new customers to ach/zelle/wire/credit card/cash on first orders and that helped.

Each industry has its own flow, so you have to really get creative on how you address it. Not sure what you sell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r5ibeh/growing_too_fast_and_drowning_in_cash_flow_issues/o5j5jva/,Comment
o5m9r0f,Customer did not pay import duties or accept parcel and wants me to reship the returned parcel for free,To be fair “just giving that person a refund” would involve me being out of pocket three times the cost of the product they decided they no longer want. I’m a very small business. I cannot afford to eat those losses. It was a $40 item. She was offered the option to reship it. This exercise was not free. It cost me time and money and I am not responsible for local carrier notifications. This is not a viable business model for me. If I have to refund because someone doesn’t take responsibility for their parcel then I have to cancel international shipping for everyone. It’s simply not reasonable or fair,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r5agme/customer_did_not_pay_import_duties_or_accept/o5m9r0f/,Comment
o5gjias,Help!,"I’m going to say this as directly as necessary: if you can’t afford good accounting (not just the technical aspects of doing the books, the actual “how do I account for where my money is going”), you can’t afford to be in business. 

My CPA/bookkeeper was the first thing I spent money on, and it’s the last expense I would cut if I needed to save money. 

Knowing every facet of my cash flow, P&amp;L and financial situation is the only way I can make good business decisions. If I don’t understand the money, I don’t understand the business. I really can’t understate how fundamental this is; making business decisions without understanding the financials is like driving a race car with a blindfold on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r53jn7/help/o5gjias/,Comment
o1hmgi1,Married couple running a business together and I feel like I’m disappearing. How do you survive this?,"We went through something quite similar, except that my husband is much more involved in the business and at home. But we were in a highly stressful industry, and at the stage that we either expanded or shut down (not by choice, but post-covid market dictated that we grow or we close). Plus, just like you, we have a toddler.

We chose family. We'd scale down if we could, but scale down is not an option, we can't survive with our profit margin. So we sold everything and moved on.

From your comments it seems like your business is going through a growing pain. And as important as he thinks the technical part is, without properly handling the admin side of business, the company would just run itself to the ground. He has a choice to either:
- dip in with house work (like he's supposed to do anyway, it's his house too, not just yours!) so you can focus on training the new girl,
- or you raise your price, scale everything down, less client and less admin work. Probably still the same money.

If he doesn't like either, then the only logical way to keep the marriage is to dissolve the company, and you both work somewhere else separately. But make sure he understands it's HIS choice, you're supporting whatever decision he makes.

Personally, I'd definitely prefer to increase my rate. I'm still pissed off because I couldn't do it in our business, the price sensitivity is real pain in ours.

And couple therapy if you can. I don't, can't, and refuse to understand a partner/parent that just do their day work and drop all the household chores to the other. It's unacceptable in my opinion, so I think you will need professional help to get him to understand that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qle6zz/married_couple_running_a_business_together_and_i/o1hmgi1/,Comment
o3d37i6,I didn’t expect the loneliest part of running a small business to be making decisions alone,"We had the same fear (dog walking company), however there does come a time where you do need a day. Even if its just to tidy up, get groceries, nap and watch a good show 

Sure it takes planning ahead , but they key is communicating with customers a month or so in advance that youre going to take a small vacation and usually theyre happy for you

Just pick a low season and maybe only do 2 days. Your relationship will be stronger for it. Which in the end will only help you more

Work on hiring a part time person who can help cover you even if its not full coverage thats something. Check your state laws on contractor vs employee classification. Look for a virtual assistant (upwork is great), a friend of mine who runs popular beauty service said having her VA for 3 years now changed everything. Her and I discussed it for years before we found her one and its been incredible.

FOR BAD REVIEWS: I love this moment! What a fabulous way to show your customer service. ""Im so sorry you weren't able to get a hold of us x day. As stated on our Google business profile, website and our customer emails, we were with family at the time. We would still love to connect and see if we can help! 

Also as offense, every week ask like 1 or 2 customers to leave a review based on their experience. We did a free dog walk and were super careful to ask they leave their *honest* experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qsc1ax/i_didnt_expect_the_loneliest_part_of_running_a/o3d37i6/,Comment
